# Student Simulator

A Python framework for simulating student-item interactions. Generate interpretable, configurable student behavior data for educational research, adaptive systems, and learning analytics.

The student model incorporates ideas from:

* **Item Response Theory**: student 'ability' and item difficulty are on a logit scale
* **Cognitive Diagnostic Modeling**: items are skill-aligned, and skills have prerequisites.
* **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing**: student skill level are dynamic and can change
* **Practice**: student skill levels change through practice.
* **Lessons**: A successful lesson 'unlocks' practice effects.
* **Forgetting**: forgetting a function of time

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
```

```python
from studentsimulator.skill import Skill, SkillSpace
from studentsimulator.student import Student
from studentsimulator.activity_provider import ActivityProvider
from studentsimulator.factory import create_random_students
from studentsimulator.io import save_student_daily_skill_states_to_csv, save_student_events_to_csv

# Define skills with prerequisites and learning parameters
skills = [
    Skill(
        name="counting",
        prerequisites={"parent_names": []},
        practice_increment_logit=0.1,
        initial_skill_level_after_learning=0.5
    ),
    Skill(
        name="addition",
        prerequisites={"parent_names": ["counting"]},
        practice_increment_logit=0.12,
        initial_skill_level_after_learning=0.4
    ),
    Skill(
        name="multiplication",
        prerequisites={"parent_names": ["addition"]},
        practice_increment_logit=0.15,
        initial_skill_level_after_learning=0.3
    )
]

skill_space = SkillSpace(skills=skills)

# Create students
student = Student(name="alice", skill_space=skill_space)
student.randomly_initialize_skills(practice_count=[3, 10])

# Or create multiple random students at once
students = create_random_students(skill_space=skill_space, n_students=5, practice_count=[1, 20])

# Create activity provider and assessment
provider = ActivityProvider()
provider.register_skills(skill_space)
item_pool = provider.construct_item_pool(
    name="math_pool",
    skills=skill_space.skills,
    n_items_per_skill=20,
    difficulty_logit_range=(-2, 2),
    guess_range=(0.1, 0.3),
    slip_range=(0.01, 0.2),
    discrimination_range=(1.0, 2.0)
)

# Administer lesson and practice
provider.administer_lesson(student=student, skill=skill_space.skills[0])
provider.administer_practice(student, skill=skill_space.skills[0], n_items=5, item_pool=item_pool)

# Create and administer assessment
assessment = provider.generate_fixed_form_assessment(
    n_items=10,
    item_pool=item_pool,
    skills=skill_space.skills
)
results = provider.administer_fixed_form_assessment(student, assessment)
print(f"{student.name}: {results[0].percent_correct:.1f}% correct")

# Save results
save_student_daily_skill_states_to_csv([student], "students_daily_skill_states.csv")
save_student_events_to_csv(
    [student],
    "student_events.csv",
    activity_provider_name=provider.name,
    train_val_test_split=(0.8, 0.0, 0.2),
    observation_rate=0.05
)
```

- **Adaptive systems** - Generate training data for ML models
- **Curriculum planning** - Understand skill dependencies and transfer relationships

## ðŸ§  Skill Transfer

The simulator models skill transfer effects where practicing a skill also benefits its prerequisite skills with diminishing returns. This is based on educational research showing that learning in one domain can benefit related domains, particularly when there are hierarchical relationships.

```python
# Practice multiplication (benefits multiplication, addition, and counting)
student.practice(skill_space.get_skill("multiplication"))

# Check that all skills improved with diminishing effects
print(f"Multiplication: {student.skills['multiplication'].skill_level}")
print(f"Addition: {student.skills['addition'].skill_level}")
print(f"Counting: {student.skills['counting'].skill_level}")
```

## ðŸ“Š Dual-History System

The simulator maintains two complementary data structures:
- **Event History**: Detailed records of all learning events, practice sessions, and assessments
- **Daily Skill States**: Efficient snapshots of skill levels at the end of each day

This dual approach enables both detailed event analysis and efficient skill trajectory visualization.

```python
# Access event history for detailed analysis
events = student.skills.get_individual_events()

# Access daily skill states for efficient plotting
daily_states = student.skills.end_of_day_skill_states

# Plot skill trajectories over time
from studentsimulator.analytics import plot_skill_trajectory
plot_skill_trajectory(student, filename="learning_trajectory.png")

# Simulate time passing with forgetting
student.wait(days=7)  # Skills decay over time
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
