# Student Simulator

A Python framework for simulating student learning and assessment interactions. Generate interpretable, configurable student behavior data for educational research, adaptive systems, and learning analytics.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
```

```python
from studentsimulator.skill import Skill, SkillSpace
from studentsimulator.student import Student
from studentsimulator.activity_provider import ActivityProvider
from studentsimulator.io import save_student_daily_skill_states_to_csv, save_student_events_to_csv

# Define skills with prerequisites and learning parameters
skills = [
    Skill(
        name="counting",
        prerequisites={"parent_names": []},
        practice_increment_logit=0.1,
        initial_skill_level_after_learning=0.5
    ),
    Skill(
        name="addition",
        prerequisites={"parent_names": ["counting"]},
        practice_increment_logit=0.12,
        initial_skill_level_after_learning=0.4
    ),
    Skill(
        name="multiplication",
        prerequisites={"parent_names": ["addition"]},
        practice_increment_logit=0.15,
        initial_skill_level_after_learning=0.3
    )
]

skill_space = SkillSpace(skills=skills)

# Create students
student = Student(name="alice", skill_space=skill_space)
student2 = Student(skill_space=skill_space).randomly_initialize_skills(practice_count=[3, 10])

# Create assessment
provider = ActivityProvider(name='MyActivityProvider')
provider.register_skills(skill_space)
item_pool = provider.construct_item_pool(
    name="math_pool",
    skills=skill_space.skills,
    n_items_per_skill=20,
    difficulty_logit_range=(-2, 2),
    guess_range=(0.1, 0.3),
    slip_range=(0.01, 0.2),
    discrimination_range=(1.0, 1.0)
)
assessment = provider.generate_fixed_form_assessment(n_items=10, item_pool=item_pool, skills=skill_space)

# Students take assessment
results = provider.administer_fixed_form_assessment(student, assessment)
print(f"{student.name}: {results[0].percent_correct:.1f}% correct")

# Save results
save_student_daily_skill_states_to_csv([student, student2], "students_daily_skill_states.csv")
save_student_events_to_csv([student, student2], "student_events.csv", activity_provider_name='MyActivityProvider')
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Skill-based learning** with prerequisite relationships and skill transfer effects
- **Dual-history system** for efficient event tracking and daily skill snapshots
- **Realistic learning parameters** based on educational research
- **Event-driven architecture** for rich interaction tracking
- **Visualization tools** for skill dependencies and mastery
- **CSV export** for analysis in other tools
- **Skill transfer modeling** with diminishing returns to ancestor skills
- **Machine learning integration** with train/validation/test splits

## ðŸ”¬ Use Cases

- **Educational research** - Study learning progression patterns and skill transfer effects
- **Assessment design** - Test item validity and difficulty
- **Adaptive systems** - Generate training data for ML models
- **Curriculum planning** - Understand skill dependencies and transfer relationships

## ðŸ§  Skill Transfer

The simulator models skill transfer effects where practicing a skill also benefits its prerequisite skills with diminishing returns. This is based on educational research showing that learning in one domain can benefit related domains, particularly when there are hierarchical relationships.

```python
# Practice multiplication (benefits multiplication, addition, and counting)
student.practice(skill_space.get_skill("multiplication"))

# Check that all skills improved with diminishing effects
print(f"Multiplication: {student.skills['multiplication'].skill_level}")
print(f"Addition: {student.skills['addition'].skill_level}")
print(f"Counting: {student.skills['counting'].skill_level}")
```

## ðŸ“Š Dual-History System

The simulator maintains two complementary data structures:
- **Event History**: Detailed records of all learning events, practice sessions, and assessments
- **Daily Skill States**: Efficient snapshots of skill levels at the end of each day

This dual approach enables both detailed event analysis and efficient skill trajectory visualization.

```python
# Access event history for detailed analysis
events = student.event_history

# Access daily skill states for efficient plotting
daily_states = student.end_of_day_skill_states

# Plot skill trajectories over time
from studentsimulator.analytics import plot_skill_trajectory
plot_skill_trajectory(student, filename="learning_trajectory.png")
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```bash
